# Project Overview
"Advances such as faster processors, high-speed networks, and large memory capacities have created a spiral of complexity through which computer scientists must navigate. Throughout all of this rapid evolution, a number of basic principles have remained constant."  
_[Brad Miller, David Ranum - 'Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures']_

The "goal" of the project is to keep all those `basic principles` in one place as a reference on the fundamentals of software engineering and its application for **solving problems**.
